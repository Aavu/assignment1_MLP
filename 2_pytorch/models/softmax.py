        Create components of a softmax classifier and initialize their weights.

        Arguments:

        Take a batch of images and run them through the classifier to
        produce a score for each class.

        Arguments:
            images (Variable): A tensor of size (N, C, H, W) where
                N is the batch size
                C is the number of channels
                H is the image height

        Returns:
            A torch Variable of size (N, n_classes) specifying the score
            for each example and category.
